### Hello, I'm Rasyid Ridha.

I am currently working in telecommunication industry as a data guy, mining and gaining interesting insights from the huge amount of data. 

Most of my works are done using R with [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) philosophy. I do end to end analysis using R for database connection (`RJDBC`, `DBI`), data manipulation (`dplyr`, `tidyr`), data visualization (`ggplot2`, `leaflet`), machine learning (`caret`) and reporting (R Markdown). 

Let's discuss interesting things, especially the one that is related to data.
