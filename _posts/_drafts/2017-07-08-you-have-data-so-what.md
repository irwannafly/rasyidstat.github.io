There are unlimited possibilities through the data. You can manipulate data in many forms, aggregate them to make a summary or maybe build a new variable to enrich your data. You can visualize one dataset into multiple visualization. You can build machine learning or statistical model from the data. You also can combine the data with other things out there which can generate new, unexpected and interesting insight. 

It all depends on your purpose that you have decide from the first time before, when and after you explore the data. That's why asking the right questions before seeing through the data is very important. Maybe, due to the limitation of time, human resource or computing power, you should be smart enough to prioritize what do you want to get from the data. The key is that your data is deliverable into actionable insights which can impact the performance or profitability of a system or business.
