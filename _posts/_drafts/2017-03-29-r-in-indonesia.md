title: R in Indonesia?

I am just curious. How many people in Indonesia are using R for their daily job?
I never find any R community in Indonesia like R Indonesia or whatever. R popularity in many companies in Indonesia is not that prominent, I hypothesize. Just take a sample, how many of my statistics friends are using R for their daily job? I hypothesize again that it will not reach 5%. I believe that most of us still use the obsolete Microsoft Excel.
