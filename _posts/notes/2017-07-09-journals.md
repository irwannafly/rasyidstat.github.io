I found out interesting journals to read. Nowadays, I am very interested in gaining insights from telecomunnication data into the new level. The data is very vast and many things are still uncovered. It is a compelex data because it brings two aspects: spatial and temporal (cross-sectional data). It is very hard to build a visualization or building a spatio-temporal model from those data.

Topics: telecommunication, usage behaviour, customer experience, customer analytics
