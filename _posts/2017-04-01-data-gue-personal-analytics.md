I am just interested with data that I generate. As the starter of my side project, I would like to take a look at my lunch and transportation data generated on this first Q1 2017. For the next project, I have a plan to explore the other side of my personal data like Twitter, flight history, book list, etc.
I just want to record and visualize some of my life data as well as rehearse my R programming skills.

Enjoy and take a look at my personal analytics data here!
