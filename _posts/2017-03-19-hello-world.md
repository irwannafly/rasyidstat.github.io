Welcome to other medium of my writing!

It is not that simple because officially, today, I have three mediums to write: in Blogger, Medium and now in Github. 

To simplify, my Blogger website, [emrasy.id](http://www.emrasy.id) will be a place for me to write a long story (typically more than 700 words). The writing frequency is about once a month or once per two months (easier said than be done). In other hand, my [Medium](https://medium.com/@rasyidstat) will be a place for me to write a short story (typically more than 150 words and less than 500 words), as known as the longer version of my Tweet which can only contains 140 characters. I will spend much time on Medium for reading, not for writing after all. In addition, I opened my Github website to store my code, my personal and side project, as well as to write about my life in a data science way. I also want to include my R Markdown project here as the part of the website. My Github website is planned to be full in english, different with my Blogger website which mostly covers in Bahasa. 

In a nutshell, here is the compendium of my writing channel.

|Channel|Content|Language|Word Counts|
|---|---|---|---|j
|[emrasy.id](http://www.emrasy.id)|Mixed|Bahasa, English|>500|
|[rasyidridha.com](http://rasyidridha.com)|Project|English|250-1000|l
|[Medium](https://medium.com/@rasyidstat)|Mixed|Bahasa, English|<500|

For your information, I start tracking my life more seriously this year, by tracking my spending habit, lunch, as well as transportation and banking history like I have planned on my writing [here](http://www.emrasy.id/2017/02/garap-data-pribadi-di-tahun-2017.html). With new additional data, I also would like to visualize them into a single framework on this website. Therefore, Github website will be a place for me to share, improve my coding skills and present my masterpiece to others.

My personal projects that I have build and plan to do are:	

* Human Resource Analytics
	* Explore PCPM BI 31 Squad (version 1)
	* Explore PCPM BI 32 Squad (not build yet)
	* Take a Glance at GPTP Telkom Candidate Data (not build yet)
	* LPDP Awardee Data Exploration (not build yet)
	* Get to Know with Nakama Tokopedia (not build yet)
* Personal Analytics
	* My Lunch (version 1)
	* GO-JEK: Make me Mobile (not build yet)
	* My Spending (not build yet)
	* Look back: My GPA (not build yet)
* Statistika Unpad 2012 / PDM Group
	* Where are My Friends Work? (not build yet)
	* Stat Unpad 2012 Marriage Clairvoyance (not build yet)
	* Visualize PDM (version 1)
	* Visualize PDM Further (not build yet)
	* My Twitter Data and The Other Similar Stuffs (version 1)


Some of them will be included on this website. In some cases, I will just include rendered pages without the .Rmd files and data source.
