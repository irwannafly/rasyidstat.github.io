My first question is that why do I do this?
- I want to know
- I want to rehearse

All what you see on this webiste is just a playground for me in rehearsing, seeing the unseen and writing my ideas. I believe that some universities in Indonesia is already tracing their alumni. I got a simple email from my campus and they ask me whether I have already got a job or not and if yes, when is the start date of my job. I know that they want to know how long that I can get my first job since graduating. Unfortunately, the data that I sent back to them via replied mail is not structured, not in a good tabular form. My question is do they re-type back ? This is silly to get my data in data preparation phase.

Alumni database can be very powerful if it applies to university. Maybe, a university can propose or modify the curriculum or whatever decision that they can made based on their alumni data.
