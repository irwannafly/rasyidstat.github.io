Tepat satu tahun belakang, I officially got in touch with nine-to-five world for the first time. I did not expect that I will get my hand dirty with the data in e-commerce industry. I took about 88 days to land my first job. In that time range, I improved myself by learning many things. I attended a community leadership workshop. I learnt Python because of one of test required me to use it. I learnt dplyr and ggplot2 for the first time although I already used R on college for more than three years (how pity is that). 

I learn many things in the last one year. I level up my R skill and become better in handling data. To recap, here are what I have learnt.

Saya belajar banyak hal selama satu tahun belakang ini.

I mostly implemented R for data pulling from database, built data workflow automation, sent email via R, etc. I loved it because I learnt a lot about SQL language like join, sub-query, group by, etc.

I am getting better at data wrangling and data visualization. However, that is not enough. I still have many challenges like playing with spatio-temporal data and visualize it interactively. That is not that easy though. Up to this time, I am unable to make an awesome spatial data visualization in R. 

I build this Github website in purpose to improve myself.
