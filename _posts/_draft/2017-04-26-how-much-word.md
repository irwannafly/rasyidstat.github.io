title: How much words?
categories:

One of my life KPI is measured by how much words that I have written. Last year, I fail to accomplish my writing resolution to write at least 200k words. Actually, I need about 15k words to make sure that my 2016 year resolution is fully accomplished. Now, in 2017, I set a higher target to write at least 300k words. I do not only count how much words that I have written on my personal writing ecosystem, Life Architecture but also I will count from the other source like this Github website. Via Life Architecure framework, I actively write my writing on the document named `New Stratch`. Based on Microsoft Word, I have already written about 66k words until `date`. However, I will use a better approach to count the words via R programming or Python within a specific rule (e.g. I do not include words less than one letter or two letters). Here is the summary of how much words that I have written until `date` from various platforms.

Could I reach my target to write at least 300k words? 

There is one semester behind. I just need to write more.
